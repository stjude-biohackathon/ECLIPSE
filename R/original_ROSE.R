#' Calculate cutoff by sliding a diagonal line
#'
#' Calculates a cutoff value by sliding a diagonal line over the sorted input vector and finding the point where it is tangential (or as close as possible) to the data.
#'
#' @param inputVector Numeric vector of data points.
#' @param drawPlot Logical indicating whether to draw a plot. Defaults to `TRUE``.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to the `plot`` function.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#' - `absolute`: The cutoff value (y-value at the tangential point).
#' - `overMedian`: Fold over the median (cutoff divided by the median of `inputVector`).
#' - `overMean`: Fold over the mean (cutoff divided by the mean of `inputVector`).
